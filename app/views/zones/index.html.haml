        Here we have a simple but interesting sample of our new stuning and smooth popup. As you can see jQuery and CSS does it easy...  
      %br  
        We can use it for popup-forms and more... just experiment!  
      %br  
        Press ESCAPE, Click on X (right-top) or Click Out from the popup to close the popup!
